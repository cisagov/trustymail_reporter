%\large
Email underpins interactions between government agencies and enables direct correspondence with US citizens, immigrants, and international users. However, email was not built with security in mind, and without supplementary configuration or architecture it lacks important properties of trusted communication. Several email authentication technologies work in harmony to enable a recipient to detect and mitigate fraudulent email, particularly SPF and DMARC.

% One valuable property that can be added to email is authentication. Without it, malicious actors can trivially exploit a perceived relationship of trust between an organization (or the organization's internet domains) and a selected target, which can lead to a loss of reputation for the organization and to legitimate email being blocked from delivery.

This weekly report, created by the National Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services (NCATS) team inside the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), is intended to assist your agency to comply with the email security aspects of \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov}{Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 18-01}. Implementation guidance can be found at \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/guide}{https://cyber.dhs.gov/guide}.

We measure the presence of SPF and DMARC records in the DNS for your agency's publicly accessible .gov hostnames, as well as support for STARTTLS by your agency's SMTP servers.  This report includes all agency-registered \href{https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv}{second-level .gov domains} and known subdomains, collectively referred to as "hostnames" in this document. Any hostnames that respond with NXDOMAIN (``nonexistent") in the public DNS are removed from the compliance figures below.\\~\\

<<&agency>> has \textbf{\numprint{<<all_eligible_domains_count>>}} hostnames that responded to DNS requests over the public Internet:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item \numprint{<<eligible_domains_count>>} second-level .gov domains (\numprint{<<base_domain_supports_smtp_count>>} responded to SMTP)
  \item \numprint{<<eligible_subdomains_count>>} subdomains (\numprint{<<subdomain_supports_smtp_count>>} responded to SMTP)
\end{itemize}
<<&agency_id>> has \textbf{\numprint{<<base_domain_plus_smtp_subdomain_count>>}} hostnames that are either second-level .gov domains, or are subdomains that respond to SMTP requests.  This set of hostnames is used below to report on STARTTLS, SPF and BOD 18-01 metrics.

The following table shows STARTTLS, SPF, and DMARC data for <<&agency>> hostnames. Hostnames which are not ``live" (i.e., requests to the DNS return an NXDOMAIN answer) are disregarded and not within scope, except in rare cases where a non-live domain has one or more live subdomains.  This table shows all second-level domains and those subdomains with a DMARC record set directly. (DMARC records set at the base domain impact subdomains in a ``wildcard-like" fashion, unless there is a DMARC record set at the subdomain directly.) Subdomains that do not support SMTP are excluded from the table below.\\~\\
% Domains which are currently being used for email are in italics.

\section{Background}
\label{app:background}
DHS seeks to incentivize the thoughtful deployment of email authentication technologies and generally increase the security of messages to and from government agencies.

This section is a recital and elaboration of key points in two recent Federal documents:

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item \href{http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-177.pdf}{Special Publication 800-177}, \textit{Trustworthy Email}, which the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued in September 2016
	\item \href{https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/businesses-can-help-stop-phishing-protect-their-brands-using-email-authentication-ftc-staff/email_authentication_staff_perspective.pdf}{Businesses Can Help Stop Phishing and Protect their Brands Using Email Authentication}, issued in March 2017 by the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection based on a study performed by the Office of Technology Research and Investigation. The report's recommendations apply equally well to government agencies.\\~\\
\end{enumerate}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{What is email authentication?}% Adds subsection to toc
\textbf{\color{dhs-dark-gray}{\Large{What is email authentication?}}}\\~\\

``Email authentication" refers to a set of technologies that enable:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item a domain owner to assert control over its domains, making them harder to successfully spoof in email.
  \item the recipient of an email to have reasonable confidence that a message which purports to be from a given domain is genuine or not.
\end{itemize}

Email authentication can impede the delivery of phishing emails that attempt to play off an organization's domain names. This protects:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item the sender's reputation and keeps likely-harmful emails out of recipient mailboxes.
  \item the public who might receive authoritative-sounding emails claiming to be from a .gov address.
  \item internal government users who may rely on information that appears to come, e.g., from an important colleague.
\end{itemize}

There are three predominant forms of email authentication technology: \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/intro/#spf--dkim}{SPF}, \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/intro/#spf--dkim}{DKIM}, and \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/intro/#dmarc}{DMARC}. Conceptually, each operate similarly:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
  \item When an email arrives at a recipient mail server, it queries the sending domain's DNS to check for relevant email authentication records.
  \item If email authentication records are found, the server evaluates the email it received against the email authentication records and makes a determination: deliver it, deliver it but mark it as questionable, or discard it altogether.
\end{enumerate}

See \href{http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-177.pdf#page=37}{SP 800-177, section 4} for a detailed technical description. For additional information, please see \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/intro}{https://cyber.dhs.gov/intro}.\\~\\~\\

\section{Methodology}
\label{app:Methodology}

The measurements in this report are derived from \texttt{trustymail}, our \href{https://github.com/dhs-ncats/trustymail}{open source STARTTLS/SPF/DMARC scanner}. All owned .gov domains {\small\lbrack\href{https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv}{https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv}]} and known subdomains are included. Subdomains are gathered from the following sources:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
  \item General Services Administration's Digital Analytics Program (DAP), which nightly publishes a dataset of federal hostnames {\small\lbrack\href{https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/sites-extended.csv}{https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/sites-extended.csv}]} for which the DAP observed at least one recorded visit in the previous 14 days.
  \item Censys {\small\lbrack\href{https://censys.io}{https://censys.io}]} is used to query the 'Common Name' field and 'Subject Alternative Name' extension on X.509 certificates found on Federal .gov sites, derived from scans of the IPv4 space and from certificates submitted to public Certificate Transparency logs.
  \item End of Term Web Archive Project {\small\lbrack\href{http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/}{http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/}]}, which captures and saves U.S. Government websites at the end of presidential administrations.
  \item Hostnames gathered from Cyber Hygiene scans.
\end{itemize}

Your agency is also welcome to request additional domains/subdomains be scanned that you find missing from this report by emailing \href{mailto:ncats@hq.dhs.gov}{ncats@hq.dhs.gov}.\\~\\~\\
